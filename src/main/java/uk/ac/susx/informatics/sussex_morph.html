<h1>Morphological and Orthographic Tools for English</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Tools for inflectional morphological analysis and generation, and for
determining the orthography of the indefinite article are now available.</p><p>

The tools are:

</p><dl>
<dt>
morpha
</dt><dd>
a fast and robust morphological analyser for English based on finite-state
techniques that returns the lemma and inflection type of a word, given the
word form and its part of speech. (The latter is optional but accuracy is
degraded if it is not present).

<br></dd><dt>
morphg
</dt><dd>
generates a word form given a specification of the lemma, part-of-speech,
and the type of inflection required. Morphg is derived automatically from
morpha, ensuring consistency and reversability of the tools.
An option controls British English or American English behaviour with
respect to consonant doubling.

<br></dd><dt>
<a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/johnca/ana1.02.tgz">ana</a>
</dt><dd>
postprocesses text to insert the correct form of the indefinite article
(i.e. <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>). Ana encodes a set of rules keying off the
pronunciation of the next word (so <i>an</i> is produced if the following
word starts with a vowel sound, and <i>a</i> otherwise). The tool handles
plain text, part of speech-tagged text and SGML among other possible formats.

<p>
The tools are implemented using widely-available unix utilities. Ana is
free for research purposes; for any proposed commercial use please contact
John Carroll. Morpha and morphg are included in the open source
<a href="http://ilexir.co.uk/applications/rasp/download/">RASP system</a>.

tools.

The tools were initially developed in the UK EPSRC-funded <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=GR/L53175/01">PSET
project</a> and were further developed on the <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=GR/N36493/01">RASP project</a>.
